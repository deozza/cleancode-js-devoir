## Fight method analysis

### Is this method written with clean code in mind ?

This method is not written with clean code principles in mind for the following reasons:

- Readability: The method is long and contains multiple nested conditional statements, which can make it hard to follow.
- Duplication: The logic for calculating damage based on weapon type is the same for both the player and the enemy.
- Function Length: The method is too long and its doing too many things at once.

### What are the issues ?

- Duplication of Weapon Damage Logic: The same switch-case structure for calculating damage is used for both player and enemy weapons. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Complexity: The flow is hard to follow due to deep nesting and multiple responsibilities (calculating damage, updating health, checking for game over conditions).
- Use of any type: Using any for weapon types can lead to potential runtime errors, as TypeScript's type checking won't catch errors related to weapon properties.
- Returning multiple types: The return type is an array of mixed types (Array<number | boolean>), which is not very descriptive and can lead to confusion.
- Error Handling: The error handling is minimal and doesn't provide detailed information about what went wrong.

### How do we improve it ?

- Separate Damage Calculation: Create a separate function to handle damage calculation based on weapon type, which can be reused for both player and enemy.
- Use Constants: Define weapon types and their corresponding damage values in a const object to improve readability and manageability.
- Separate Responsibility: Break down the fight function into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility (e.g., calculating damage, updating health, checking game state).
- Descriptive Return Type: Define a specific interface for the return value of the fight function, which will improve type safety and readability.
- Improve Error Messages: Make error messages more descriptive and user-friendly.
