# Analysis of the `fight` Method

## Issues

1. **Long Method** : The `fight` method is too long and does too many things. It's hard to understand it, a method need to do only one thing 

2. **Nested conditionals** : The `fight` method has a realy deep nested conditionals and that make it difficult to read and understand it.

3. **Magic Numbers** : The `figth` method use a lot of magic number that are not self-explanatory, making it hard to understand 

4. **Repetitive code** : both switchs are identical

5. **Many Return Types**: The `fight` method returns an array with mixed types, which can lead to errors.

5. **No failFast** : The `fight` method need to handle fail condition first to prevent using nested conditionals and many else.

6. **Any type** : using the any type for the playersweapon

## Suggested Fixes

1. **Refactor into Smaller Methods**: Break down the `fight` method into smaller, more focused methods that do only one task.

2. **Reduce Nesting**: Flatten the nested conditionals by using 
failFast method.

3. **Use Constants**: Replace magic numbers with named constants to make the code more clean.

4. **DRY Principle**: Extract the repetitive switch statement logic and conditions into separate methods.

6. **One Return Type**: Use a consistent return type, such as an object, to make the return values more understandable.

7. **Remove comments** : The comments in this method are not usefull we need to remove them

8. **Any type** : add a weapon interface
